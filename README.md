# project 3: Spots

This is my first project using READ.ME and based on my tutors feedback, I will update my codes in the next post.As 

## Project Description

1. This project is aimed at achieving responsive webpage with a design in _FIGMA_. Flexbox, grid and media query were remarkable in making the webpage responsive.

- Phones

- Tablets [(./images/demo/tablet-view.png)]
- Desktops [(./images/demo/desktop-view.png)]

2. I added form section that pops up on clicking edit button.

### Techniques used in the project

- I used **BEM** file structure and **BEM consistent** class names
- I took all my videos from _Figma_ Spots.
- I used the `<ul>` semantic instead of `<figure>` in the HTML for cards section.

- I rewrote imported file names to avoid spacing and capital letters, here is one example [(./images/rectangle_2.svg)]

- I used javascript to add event listeners that respond on clicking buttons and submitting forms.

- Used template to clone the image cards. So images are added using javascript.

#### Here is the updated part in the project:
Here things have taken a differnt twist for I used a server based application.
So, all data are send and requested using an API.To enable API,I created a file 
in utils folder (api.js).Now users can add their own images and update profile 
info and avatar image.Moreover, they can delete images they don't like.
