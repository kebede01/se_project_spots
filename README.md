# project 3: Spots

This is my first project using READ.ME and based on my tutors feedback, I will update my codes in the next post.

## Project Description

This project is aimed at achieving responsive webpage with a design in _FIGMA_. Flexbox, grid and media query were remarkable in making the webpage responsive.

- Tablets [(./images/demo/tablet-view.png)]
- Desktops [(./images/demo/desktop-view.png)]

### Techniques used in the project

- I used **BEM** file structure and **BEM consistent** class names
- I took all my videos from _Figma_ Spots.
- I used the `<ul>` semantic instead of `<figure>` in the HTML for cards section.

- I rewrote imported file names to avoid spacing and capital letters, here is one example [(./images/rectangle_2.svg)]
